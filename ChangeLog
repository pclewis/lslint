	- added PAY_HIDE, PAY_DEFAULT, DATA_SIM_RATING constants (0012, reported by Kayla Stonecutter)
	- changed to gcc-style if(a=x) warnings; if((a=x)) doesn't warn.

	- fix crash when using global vectors/rotations in operations (0009, reported by Strife)
	- fix crash when using -v
	- fix vector.s, vector.qqq, vector.1, etc (0010)
	- when a warning or error has extra lines of information, they will only be shown once
	- exit status is the number of errors in the script (negative or >128 for program errors)
	- added options: -# (show error numbers), -A (check error assertions)
		these are for debugging/regression testing, but you can use them to ignore warning
		messages. use -# to get the error number, and then add a comment like $[E12345]
		on the line you want to ignore that error number on. note that when using -A,
		warnings are treated as errors.

0.2.1: 2006-02-12
	- support vector/quaternion constants and (some) operators
	- fix crash when recovering from statement with syntax error (0007, reported by Strife)
	- log messages sorted by type and line number, use -S to disable

0.2.0: 2006-02-10
	- internal:
		- rewritten as pure/reentrant parser/lexer
		- logging abstracted for later sorting support
		- track and propogate constant values
		- better location tracking
		- fixed list parsing

	- added options:
		-v Be verbose (version changed to -V), 
		-l Show line/column info as range (ex: (1,4)-(1,18))

	- fixed bugs:
